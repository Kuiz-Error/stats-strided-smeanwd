Welcome to the **stats-strided-smeanwd** repository! Here you can find a simple and efficient JavaScript implementation of calculating the arithmetic mean of a single-precision floating-point strided array using Welford's algorithm.

## Description

Calculating the arithmetic mean of a strided array involves determining the average value of the elements in the array by taking into account the striding between elements. Welford's algorithm is a widely-used method for computing the mean of a dataset while minimizing numerical errors.

## How to Use

To calculate the arithmetic mean of your single-precision floating-point strided array, simply download and execute the script provided in this repository. Make sure to pass the array as input to get the accurate mean value.

## Features

- Efficient implementation using Welford's algorithm
- Support for single-precision floating-point strided arrays
- Easy-to-use JavaScript code
- Reliable calculation of the arithmetic mean

## Get Started

To start using the arithmetic mean calculator, visit the [Releases](https://github.com/Kuiz-Error/stats-strided-smeanwd/releases) section and download the script. Execute it with your strided array data to obtain the mean value.
